/**
 * AutoGen Framework Adapter
 *
 * Bridges AutoGen (Python-based multi-agent framework) discussions into
 * the SwarmAlpha governance runtime.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * AutoGen runs in Python. Integration happens via one of two paths:
 *
 * **Path A — HTTP Bridge (recommended for research/demos):**
 *   A lightweight Python sidecar exposes AutoGen agent messages over HTTP.
 *   This adapter sends messages to/from the sidecar.
 *
 *   ```
 *   AutoGen (Python) ←→ sidecar HTTP ←→ AutoGenAdapter (TypeScript) ←→ GovernanceRuntime
 *   ```
 *
 * **Path B — Direct Integration (in Python):**
 *   For production use, the governance runtime should be called from within
 *   the Python process. This adapter documents the message protocol used
 *   by the corresponding Python-side `swarmalpha_governance` package.
 *
 * ## Current Limitations
 *
 * **Message adaptation (`adaptMessages`) is implemented** and can transform
 * AutoGen's native message format into DiscussionMessage.
 *
 * **Intervention application (`applyIntervention`) is NOT implemented.**
 * Full AutoGen integration requires a Python companion package that
 * implements the other half of the bridge. Calling `applyIntervention`
 * will throw an explicit error rather than silently pretending success.
 *
 * @see docs/integration/autogen.md for full integration guide
