/**
 * Discussion Topology — Scalable Agent Grouping Abstraction
 *
 * PROBLEM: The default discussion model is a flat round-table where n agents
 * all talk to each other. This works for n≤10 but breaks at n≥20 due to:
 *   - O(n²) pairwise comparisons in governance
 *   - Overlong LLM context (all n agents' opinions in one prompt)
 *   - Information overload (agents can't track all other voices)
 *
 * SOLUTION: A topology controls how agents are partitioned into sub-groups
 * for each discussion round. After sub-group discussions, beliefs are merged
 * into the global state for governance detection and intervention.
 *
 * KEY PROPERTY: The governance pipeline (diagnose → intervene → evaluate)
 * operates on the GLOBAL agent state and is completely unchanged. Only the
 * discussion structure changes. This means the same bias detectors and
 * intervention strategies work at any scale.
 *
 * EXTENSIBILITY: To support new scaling patterns (hierarchical, federated,
 * dynamic, etc.), implement the DiscussionTopology interface. The engine
 * needs zero changes.
